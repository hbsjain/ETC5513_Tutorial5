# This is tutorial 5

In this tutorial we are learning to use git rebase, to create a .gitignore file and to collaborate with others

#  Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

```


# Examining the relationship between bill length and flipper length.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
data(package = 'palmerpenguins')
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm , y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
geom_point()
```
